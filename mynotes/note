Todo:

1. how to handle the scenario that the cookies are expired and the related token is to be deleted.

-> now, token and cookie have the same expiry date. when the auto-login with cookie fails due to expired token in the db, the token will be set to deleted and the cookie will be removed.

Remaining point is how to delete token if the cookie gets expired ???


2. user role management, admin to manage the user


3. re-issue a token after every auto-login and delete the old token
